# Seaborn-practices
Data visualization practice with Python using the Seaborn library.

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing engaging and informative statistical graphs. Here I share my practice exercises.

## Objective

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphs. Here I share my practice exercises as part of my professional development.

## Purpose

I hope it serves as a starting point, or at least a reference complement, for any other novice developer, analyst, or statistician who needs to visualize data accurately and with a careful aesthetic.

## How to

The "code" folder houses the multiple practice developments. To work from existing code or generate new subprojects, you are asked to open a branch so you can work freely and comfortably.
To date, the work philosophy is not collaborative, so branching from the project is not recommended.
